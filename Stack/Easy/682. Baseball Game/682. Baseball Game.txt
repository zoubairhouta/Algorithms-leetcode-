Problem Explanation:
You are given a list of operations.
Each operation can be:
An integer x: You need to add x to the record.
"+": You need to add a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
"D": You need to add a new score that is double the previous score.
"C": You need to remove the previous score from the record.
The goal is to return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.
Solution Approach Using Stack:
Initialize a Stack: Start with an empty stack to keep track of the scores.

Process Each Operation:

If the operation is an integer (x), push it onto the stack.
If the operation is "+", pop the top two scores, sum them, and push the sum back onto the stack.
If the operation is "D", peek at the top score, double it, and push the doubled value onto the stack.
If the operation is "C", pop the top score from the stack.
Calculate the Final Score: After processing all operations, the stack contains the valid scores. The final score is the sum of all elements in the stack.

Lessons from the Problem:
Understanding Stack Operations: This problem is a good exercise in understanding how stacks work, particularly in scenarios where the order of elements matters.
Applying Conditional Logic: Handling different types of operations requires conditional logic, a fundamental concept in programming.
Dynamic Data Handling: It shows how to handle data that changes over time with a sequence of operations.
Efficient Data Access: The problem demonstrates efficient data access and manipulation using stacks, particularly when only the most recent elements need to be accessed or modified.
