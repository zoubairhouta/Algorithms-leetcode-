This problem involves understanding and computing the nesting depth of a string that represents a valid parentheses string (VPS). Let's break down the concept and the examples provided:

Understanding a Valid Parentheses String (VPS)
Basic Definition:

An empty string "" is considered a VPS.
A single character, not a "(" or ")", is a VPS.
Concatenation Rule:

If A and B are VPS, then the string AB (A concatenated with B) is also a VPS.
Enclosure Rule:

If A is a VPS, then the string (A) (A enclosed in parentheses) is also a VPS.
Understanding Nesting Depth
The nesting depth of a VPS, depth(S), is defined as follows:

Empty or Single Non-Parentheses Character:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0 if C is a single character not "(" or ")".
Concatenation Depth:

For A and B as VPS, depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)).
Enclosed Depth:

For A as VPS, depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A).
Examples
Example 1: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"

Here, the deepest nested part is ((8)/4), which has 3 layers of parentheses.
So, the nesting depth is 3.
Example 2: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"

The deepest nested part is (((3))), also with 3 layers.
The nesting depth is 3 again.
Constraints
The length of string s is between 1 and 100.
The string consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.
It's guaranteed that the parentheses expression s is a VPS.
Key Lesson
This problem teaches how to analyze and calculate the depth of nested structures, which is a common issue in parsing and interpreting expressions, especially in programming languages and mathematical expressions. It demonstrates the importance of understanding recursion and stack-based processing in computer science.
